# ItemGenerator
tool for generating algebra exercises.
# Complexity management
Each item has its own complexity. The complexity of an item is a integer vector: each coordinate represents an item paramenter-
## Monomial complexity
The complexity for a monomial is a vector with three components: coefficient complexity, variable complexity and degree complexity.
